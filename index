//    The birthday paradox says that the probability that two people in a room will
//    have the same birthday is more than half as long as n, the number of people in
//        the room, is more than 23. This property is not really a paradox, but many
//        people find it surprising. Design a Java program that can test this paradox by a
//        series of experiments on randomly generated birthdays, which test this paradox
//        for n = 5,10,15,20,..., 100.
